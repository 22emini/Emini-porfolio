          <p>ðŸ’¼ Junior Software Engineer
          </p>
          <p> BillyRonks Internship</p>
         <p> July 2024 â€“ Present</p>
          <p>
          As a Junior Software Engineer, Iâ€™ve been actively involved in building modern, responsive web applications with a strong emphasis on clean UI/UX, performance, and maintainability. My primary focus has been on front-end development using React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, where Iâ€™ve developed reusable components, implemented animations, and collaborated on design improvements to enhance user engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
          On the backend, Iâ€™ve worked with both MySQL and MongoDB to create and manage databases for small to medium-sized web apps. Iâ€™ve built simple REST APIs using Node.js and integrated them with front-end features to enable full-stack functionality. While Iâ€™m still early in my backend journey, I enjoy the problem-solving aspect and am constantly learning best practices for scalability and security.
          </p>
          <p>
          Iâ€™m highly comfortable with version control using Git and GitHub, and I follow best practices when it comes to branching, pull requests, and writing clear commit messages. Iâ€™ve also handled end-to-end deployment using Vercel, which has helped me understand the importance of optimizing builds and keeping CI/CD pipelines efficient.
          </p>
          <p>
          Beyond just coding, Iâ€™ve contributed to planning sessions, where I learned how to break down tasks, estimate timelines, and prioritize features. I regularly document my code and thought process, which helps me stay organized and makes future collaboration smoother. Iâ€™ve also taken initiative to learn new tools, whether thatâ€™s experimenting with new libraries, diving into Linux environments, or brushing up on core programming with Java, C, and C++.
          </p>
          <p>What excites me most is being part of a team where I can contribute meaningfully, keep growing my skills, and build products that people love to use. Iâ€™m passionate about clean code, continuous improvement, and staying updated with the latest in web technologies. Every project Iâ€™ve worked on so far has taught me something new, and Iâ€™m always looking for opportunities to learn, build, and grow.</p>
